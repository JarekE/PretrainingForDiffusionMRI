The subfolders are independent programmes and can be executed independently.

The GroundTruth data already exist and the pretraining is currently only available
in a preliminary test version.

All 3 tests can be executed, but are in the basic version.

Segmentation (1)  
Number of Peaks (2)  
--- Direction of Peak (Classification) (3a)  --> killed ---
Direction of Peak (Regression) (3)
